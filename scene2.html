        <h2>Exploring CO2 Emissions</h2>

        <p>
          🌐 <strong>Why CO2 Emissions?</strong>: Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions
          are a significant contributor to global warming and climate change.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            🔍 Here we can compare CO2 emissions from various countries over the
            years, highlighting the differences and similarities in how
            countries contribute to global emissions.
          </li>
          <li>
            🌎 Countries like China and the United States are often at the top
            of the list of highest emitters due to their large populations and
            industrial activities.
          </li>
          <li>
            📊 The different shades of blue represent different years, showing
            how emissions have changed over time. Some countries have seen a
            steady increase, while others may have peaks and troughs.
          </li>
          <li>
            🌍 Typically developed countries with large industrial bases
            generally emit more CO2 than smaller, less industrialized nations.
          </li>
          <li>
            🏭 Often, a country's CO2 emissions are closely tied to its economic
            activities. Industrial growth, energy consumption, and
            transportation are major sources of CO2 emissions.
          </li>
          <li>
            📉 Changes in policy, such as the implementation of stricter
            environmental regulations or international agreements like the Paris
            Agreement, can have a significant impact on a country's emissions
            profile.
